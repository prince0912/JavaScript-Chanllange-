//  Activity Selection Problem: Given a set of activities, along with the starting and finishing time 
//  of each activity, find the maximum number of activities performed by a single person assuming that 
//  a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

// Two activities i and j are said to be non-conflicting if si = fj or sj = fi.
